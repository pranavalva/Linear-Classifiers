# Implementation of Linear Classifiers in Python

The python code consists of barebones implementations of linear classifiers such as Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbour and Logistic regression.

## Components

* NaiveBayes - Performs Naive Bayes classification with Bernoulli distribution and a Poisson prior
* kNN_predictClass - Predicts the class of the test set using K Nearest Neighbour classifier
* Confusion Matrix - Plots a confusion matrix of the predictions made by the classification algorithm
* calc_upd - Calculates the update for each iteration in logistic regression
* calc_objFun - Calculates the objective function for each iteration in logistic regression
